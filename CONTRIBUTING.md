## git commits

Follow [git's practice](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches#L266) instead of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
* 50 char soft limit for first line. no periods
* prefix with `area: ` where area is the file or general area being modified
